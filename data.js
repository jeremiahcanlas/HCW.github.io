                care need is critical to your healing and recovering. The two other partners are business professionals with a

        <h1>ONLINE COACHING/COUNSELLING
            PROGRAM – SELF LOVE AS YOU WORK
            FOR PROFESSIONALS</h1>
        <div class="container register-body">
            <p>This Coaching is running on the following dates from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm</p>
            <h1 class='date-dyn'></h1>
            <p>The purpose of this online coaching/counselling is to make a difference in the lives of men and
                women
                around the world by transforming Self love as you age, as you work or engage in a relationship.
                This
                coaching plan will not only benefit men and women in their personal lives, it will benefit you
                in
                your professional lives. It will help women or men to do soul searching, find your voice and
                learn
                how to self love by knowing that you are good enough. The vision of this evolutionary miracle
                minded
                coaching technique of self love as you age, as work, as you engage in a relationship is to train
                men
                and women to grow in their spirit of love and health. In general, women are seen as a beautiful
                flower that blooms and fades as they age, this puts a great deal of stress on women to always
                stay
                beautiful and stress over getting older. Men are thought to be strong, “macho” not to show
                emotions,
                showing emotions for men is looked down upon. Yet, men and women face all determinants of health
                such as:</p>
            <p>
                <b>Psychosocial risks include:</b> Low self-esteem, self blame (not good enough), lack of social
                support, poor social network, low perceived power and isolation
            </p>
            <p><b>Economic status risks include:</b> poverty, stressful work environments, lower education
                levels, stressful employment and working conditions discrimination related to sexism, racism,
                ageism, based on income, sex, race, culture, unaffordable housing, low political and economic
                power etc.</p>
            <p><b>Behavioural risks:</b> Men and women then develop the tendency to take out their stress and
                frustrations on themselves resulting in behaviours such as taking up smoking, alcohol, drugs,
                poor nutrition and physical inactivity resulting in excessive weight gain or obesity, as well as
                poor health and relationships. </p>
            <p><b>Physiologically/Health:</b> Men and women both are likely to suffer from Stress, Depression,
                Anxiety, eating disorder, other mental health issues, Hypertension, high cholesterol, Chronic
                pain, diabetes, congestive heart failures, and other genetic factors chronic diseases that keep
                women down and withdrawn.</p>
            <p><b>Environmental Risks:</b> Women and men are likely to be predisposed to poor living conditions
                such as poor housing situations resulting in contaminated air quality living arrangement, poor
                water quality which negatively affects health, cancer, gastrointestinal problems and
                unaffordable housing issues. Both have the right to demand for affordable and adequate housing,
                refused homelessness, and other substandard living arrangements. </p>
            <p><b>Culture:</b> Cultural and ethnic influences affect how women interact in the healthcare
                system. It also affects the belief some women have that taking care of others comes first before
                they can care for themselves or self love.</p>
            <p><b>Language</b> differences and religion of some women can lead to isolation and decrease social
                support networks. Harassment and Prejudice can deny women opportunities for education,
                employment access to safe and affordable housing. </p>
            <p><b>Gender:</b> Evidence has shown that gender does influence women’s health status, behaviours,
                and health self care and self love. Women are more likely to suffer the negative impact of lower
                levels of income, education, social support network because women are tasked with taking care of
                the kids, household, family and being a caregiver but these essential 24 hours jobs are
                discredited and taken for granted in our society.</p>
            <p><b>Relationship Risk:</b> Relationship explains the role other people play in our path to God.
                Every relationship a person encounters is an assignment. We get out of a relationship what we
                put in it because all minds are joined. The concept of forgiveness plays a critical role in
                relationships we encounter. It is important for women to experience the innocence in others and
                in themselves. Our coaching technique will demonstrate the shift in perception from fear to love
                in every relationship. For example, forgiveness of others who offended us and send them love
                instead of anger. This willingness to see the oneness in every relationship encounter is the key
                to self love. Relationships can be healthy or unhealthy. Relationships should not be
                detrimental.</p>
