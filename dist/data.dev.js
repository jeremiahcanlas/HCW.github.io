It will help you to do soul searching, find your voice and\n                learn\n                how to self love by knowing that you are good enough. The vision of this evolutionary miracle\n                minded\n                coaching technique of self love as you age, as work, engage in a relationship is to train\n                men\n                and women to grow in their spirit of love and health. In general, women are seen as a beautiful\n                flower that blooms and fades as they age, this puts a great deal of stress on women to always\n                stay\n                beautiful and stress over getting older. Men are thought to be strong, \u201Cmacho\u201D not to show\n                emotions,\n                showing emotions for men is looked down upon. Yet, men and women face all determinants of health\n                such as:</p>\n            <p>\n                <b>Psychosocial risks include:</b> Low self-esteem, self blame (not good enough), lack of social\n                support, poor social network, low perceived power and isolation\n            </p>\n            <p><b>Economic status risks include:</b> poverty, stressful work environments, lower education\n                levels, stressful employment and working conditions discrimination related to sexism, racism,\n                ageism, based on income, sex, race, culture, unaffordable housing, low political and economic\n                power etc.</p>\n            <p><b>Behavioural risks:</b> Men and women then develop the tendency to take out their stress and\n                frustrations on themselves resulting in behaviours such as taking up smoking, alcohol, drugs,\n                poor nutrition and physical inactivity resulting in excessive weight gain or obesity, as well as\n                poor health and relationships. </p>\n            <p><b>Physiologically/Health:</b> Men and women both are likely to suffer from Stress, Depression,\n                Anxiety, eating disorder, other mental health issues, Hypertension, high cholesterol, Chronic\n                pain, diabetes, congestive heart failures, and other genetic factors chronic diseases that keep\n                women down and withdrawn.</p>\n            <p><b>Environmental Risks:</b> Women and men are likely to be predisposed to poor living conditions\n                such as poor housing situations resulting in contaminated air quality living arrangement, poor\n                water quality which negatively affects health, cancer, gastrointestinal problems and\n                unaffordable housing issues. Both have the right to demand for affordable and adequate housing,\n                refused homelessness, and other substandard living arrangements. </p>\n            <p><b>Culture:</b> Cultural and ethnic influences affect how women interact in the healthcare\n                system. It also affects the belief some women have that taking care of others comes first before\n                they can care for themselves or self love.</p>\n            <p><b>Language</b> differences and religion of some women can lead to isolation and decrease social\n                support networks. Harassment and Prejudice can deny women opportunities for education,\n                employment access to safe and affordable housing. </p>\n            <p><b>Gender:</b> Evidence has shown that gender does influence women\u2019s health status, behaviours,\n                and health self care and self love. Women are more likely to suffer the negative impact of lower\n                levels of income, education, social support network because women are tasked with taking care of\n                the kids, household, family and being a caregiver but these essential 24 hours jobs are\n                discredited and taken for granted in our society.</p>\n            <p><b>Relationship Risk:</b> Relationship explains the role other people play in our path to God.\n                Every relationship a person encounters is an assignment. We get out of a relationship what we\n                put in it because all minds are joined. The concept of forgiveness plays a critical role in\n                relationships we encounter. It is important for men and women to experience the innocence in others and\n                in themselves. Our coaching technique will demonstrate the shift in perception from fear to love\n                in every relationship. For example, forgiveness of others who offended us and send them love\n                instead of anger help to free you of burden of hate. This willingness to see the oneness in every relationship encounter is the key\n                to self love. Relationships can be healthy or unhealthy. Relationships should not be\n                detrimental.</p>\n        </div>\n        <!-- THIS IS WHERE THE FORM IS, GOODLUCK BACK END -->\n        <div class=\"register-form-container container\">\n            <p>This online coaching/counselling is being held online via one on one, group sessions and\n                participants need to commit to attending all sessions.
